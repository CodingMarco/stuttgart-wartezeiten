# Frontend Service Container Configuration

This directory will contain the Docker configuration for the frontend service.

## Structure (to be implemented)
- `Dockerfile` - Container build configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service-specific compose configuration
- `.dockerignore` - Files to exclude from build context

## Notes
- The frontend will provide a web interface for viewing waiting times
- Will communicate with the API service
- Could be built with React, Vue, or another modern framework
